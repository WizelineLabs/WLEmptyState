# Contributing Guidelines

### Code of Conduct

Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
The WLEmptyState maintainers take this Code of Conduct very seriously. Intolerance, disrespect, harassment, and any form of negativity will not be tolerated.

### Ways to Contribute

You can contribute to WLEmptyState in a variety of ways:

- Fixing or reporting bugs :scream:
- Improving documentation :heart:
- Suggesting new features :smiley:
- Increasing unit test coverage :pray:
- Resolving any open issues :+1:

If you're new to Open Source or Swift, the Wizeline Open Source community is a great place to get involved.

**Your contributions are always welcome, no contribution is too small.**

### Opening a New Issue

- Please check the [README of the specific project](specific-project-readme) to see if your question is answered there.
- Search [open issues](specific-link-project) and [closed issues](specific-link-project) to avoid opening a duplicate issue.
- Avoiding duplicate issues organizes all relevant information for project maintainers and other users.
- If no issues represent your problem, please open a new issue with a good title and useful description.

- Information to Provide When Opening an Issue:
- WLEmptyState version(s)
- iOS version(s)
- Devices/Simulators affected
- Full crash log, if applicable
- A well-written description of the problem you are experiencing
- *Please provide complete steps to reproduce the issue*
- For UI related issues, please provide a screenshot/GIF/video showing the issue
- Search for a list of any issues that might be related

The more information you can provide, the easier it will be for us to resolve your issue promptly.

### Submitting a Pull Request

We maintain two permanent, protected branches: `master` and `development` also we follow the [Gitflow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) branching model.

`master` is for the latest production available code, so any bug fixes or documentation spelling fixes should be merged into this branch.

`development` is where we stage work for the *next* release, i.e., breaking API changes and related documentation updates. Contributors should gently encourage new pull-requests to point to the appropriate branch, and to rebase onto that branch if necessary.

When a new version is ready to be released, please create a pull request to merge `development` into `master`, named something like "Release 10.0". Then we can have some final discussion before we merge it into `master` and push the release out to the public.

**You should submit one pull request per feature, the smaller the pull request the better chances it will be merged.**
Enormous pull requests take a significant time to review and understand their implications on the existing codebase.

### Style Guidelines

Writing clean code and upholding project standards is as important as adding new features. To ensure this, WLEmptyState employs a few practices:

1. We use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce style and conventions at compile time.
2. We adhere to the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/).
3. We follow the [Raywenderlich Swift Style Guide ](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide) but may have slight variations.

### Questions and Contact

If any of the sections above are unclear and require further explanation, *do not hesitate to reach out* the project maintainer ios.open@wizeline.com.
WLEmptyState strives to build an inclusive, open source community and to make contributing as easy as possible for members of all experience levels.
